# CPSC490 epub script
By: Brandy Nguyen

## Description:
This is a Python script generated by ChatGPT to fix all the errors in "The Pragmatic Programmer," where there are multiple problems. The Python script is supposed to remove some images, the text lining, and removing the watermark. However, the script does not work 100% as intended and needs changes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- os module
- shutil module
- ebooklib module
- io module

## How to run:
1. Download the epub file with the term "clean" in it to get the fixed version
2. You can see the original epub file with the file without the term "clean" in it
3. It is not necessary to rerun the Python script file to see the changes.
